    <h3>A little more about me...</h3>
      <p> As a kid I grew up all moving all over the globe with my family. After college I decided to take the science I learned to a 'fun' level. I became a Mixologist and designed cocktails for corporations like Disney. Most recently I attended Tech Stars and helped raise 1.2 million for an app I had an interest in.</p>

      <p>Beginning my journey at Thinkful to becoming a software engineer will give me the ability to work remotely and I couldn't be more excited!</p>
